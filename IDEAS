1.) Study and Implement the StackGAN, StackGAN++ architecture 
	use cases:
	-> Criminal identification (text2Face)
	-> Casting help (text2Face)

* Improving the architecture's results with the following modifications:
	i.) Wasserstein's AE
	ii.) Progressive growing
	iii.) Deep - Complex Networks (very experimental)


2.) Study and Implement the SeqGAN and LeakGAN architectures
	use cases:
	-> integration with the earlier structured data to summary generation


3.) Study and implement the Spherical CNNs 
	use cases:
	i.) Classification and detection for spherical images helpful for VR team
